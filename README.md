# e4040-2019Fall-assign1
This repository (in Github Classroom) is the student version of the assignment 1 for e4040 2019 Fall.
To complete the assignment/homework, the students need to create a copy of this repository and put their solution into that repository.

INSTRUCTIONS for naming the student's solution repository for assignments with one student:
* Students need to use the following name for the repository with their solutions: e4040-2019Fall-assign1-UNI (the first part "e4040-2019Fall-assign1" will probably be inherited from the assignment, so only UNI needs to be added) 
* Initially, the system may give the repo a name which ends with a  student's Github userid. The student should change that name and replace it with the name requested in the point above
* Good Example: e4040-2019Fall-assign1-zz9999;   Bad example: e4040-2019Fall-assign1-e4040-2019Fall-assign1-zz9999.

INSTRUCTIONS for naming the students' solution repository for assignments with more students, such as the final project. Students need to use a 4-letter groupID): 
* Template: e4040-2019Fall-Project-GroupID-UNI1-UNI2-UNI3. -> Example: e4040-2019Fall-Project-MEME-zz9999-aa9999-aa0000.
